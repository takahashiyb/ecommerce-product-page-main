## Overview

### The challenge

Your challenge is to build out this e-commerce product page and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

You can use any tools you like to help you complete the challenge. So if you've got something you'd like to practice, feel free to give it a go.

Your users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Open a lightbox gallery by clicking on the large product image
- Switch the large product image by clicking on the small thumbnail images
- Add items to the cart
- View the cart and remove items from it

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

The whole exercise is a test of endurance for me. I took many breaks to just gather my thoughts on how to work on this. But I finished it in a working state and I would like to work on this again someday with better planning done before putting in a line of code. There were so many backtracking on my part in this challenge. I need to think in terms of breaking everything down in to smaller parts too since one of the hurdles in the challenge was solved by doing just that. I'm just glad I did not give up on it, and we need to keep moving.

### Continued development

In general, more experience in planning, not just the layouts this time but also how to approach each component and visualize what needs to be done in Javascript.
